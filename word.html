  <h1 class=headertext> <em>Abstract</em> and Conformity</h1>
<p class= "quotationwords"><em>Working and consuming from our houses, wired happily into what Harper’s magazine has called the electronic hive, we will each be corporate subjects—consumers and providers of “content”—as surely we were the hapless industrial proletarians of the last century.</em></p>
		<p class="quotation">—Thomas Frank, The New Gilded Age, 1995</p>

<p class= "articlewords">No longer can culture, at least in its commodifiable forms, be regarded as anything other than an economic dynamo driving consumption. In the twenty-five years since Thomas Frank wrote <em>The New Gilded Age</em>, America’s Culture Trust—the established cabal of content providers, media conglomerates, and, most recently, tech companies—remains a bloated beast, doubled down on the doctrines of consolidation, pacification, and consumption; bolstered by our increasingly online, digital society. Put simply, the electronic hive buzzes on.  </p>
	
<p class= "articlewords">  The advent of streaming initially promised a cost effective, democratized alternative to cable. <em>Cutting the cord</em> was an act of liberation, a way of escaping the clutches of <em>the man </em>and his increasingly complex packaged deals of propagandistic advertisements. Physical rentals were a declining industry and the expansion of widespread broadband in conjunction with an influx of affordable, internet enabled media devices contributed to streaming’s meteoric growth. Since the initial release of its streaming platform in 2007, Netflix has grown to have a market capitalization of 248 billion dollars and a global subscriber base nearing 200 million.  </p>

<p class= "articlewords">A quick browse of Netflix’s streaming library induces a crippling sensation, as if you’re drowning in a sea of endless choice. An excessive quantity of algorithmically produced content washes over you. All this in an effort to lull you into a gluttonous, binge-induced trance, unable to question the value of your automatic monthly subscription. Free from the advertising industry’s sweaty grasp, it seems that Netflix executives have chosen to prize quantity and variety above quality or longevity. That is to say, each month they throw an overflowing fistful of programs at a crowd of 200 million, confident that something will inevitably justify another month of monotony. And still, despite altogether lackluster programming, I would be hard-pressed to overstate the platform’s hegemonic hold on the zeitgeist.
 </p>
	
<p class= "articlewords">On February 10th, 2017, the company released an eight part documentary series titled <em>Abstract: The Art of Design</em> as part of its ever expanding campaign to produce original content. From its opening moments, it is clear that <em>Abstract </em>is extremely cool. At least, it desperately wants you to think so. The titles are colorful and flash onto the screen in an intentionally creative manner. The typefaces are minimalist and sans-serif. The score is both momentously orchestral and excitingly electronic. In 2019, it was even nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design. Everything here is refined and carefully designed. Admittedly, this is all to be expected for a show dedicated to documenting the titans of graphic design, architecture, typography, art, and everything in between.  </p>
	
<p class= "articlewords">With its shine and high production value, <em>Abstract</em> purposes to appeal to a broad audience. In accordance with most Netflix programming, it is accessible without being boring. That is, it is impossible to be bored because you are only ever a few moments away from a new and exciting animation or montage or, best of all, sequence of cinematic drone footage. Content be damned, this is the age of constant visual stimulation. Despite making you feel like you’re probably learning something, <em>Abstract </em>feigns depth and intellect without offering more than an ounce of critical reflection. Of course, the documentary medium is far from objective, with every aspect of a production instrumental in advocating for a specific ideology. For <em>Abstract, </em>that comes in the form of idolizing iconic designers in a realm ultimately devoid of context, consequence, and meaningful criticism. As a tool for indoctrination, it depicts the commercialization of art as culturally significant self expression. In this regard, it is a brutally honest representation of the broader relationship between art and capital. </p>
	
<p class= "words"> ***</p>
<p class= "articlewords"> Bjarke Ingels, architecture’s preeminent wunderkind, is mischievous, self-obsessed, and startlingly seductive. In 2016, he was named one of <em>TIME</em> magazine’s one hundred most influential people. Rem Koolhaas, Ingles’ arguable predecessor, wrote the tribute:
 </p>
<p class="quotationwords"><em>Contrary to many, maybe including himself, I do not consider Bjarke Ingels the reincarnation of this or that architect from the past. On the contrary, he is the embodiment of a fully-fledged new typology, which responds perfectly to the current zeitgeist. Bjarke is the first major architect who disconnected the profession completely from angst. He threw out the ballast and soared. With that, he is completely in tune with the thinkers of Silicon Valley, who want to make the world a better place without the existential hand-wringing that previous generations felt was crucial to earn utopianist credibility. </em></p>
<p class="quotationwords"><em>We are friends. Once, during lunchtime, I used his office to prepare a competition presentation. (We lost.) On the menu that day was quiche. Wow, I wondered, so you can do great architecture without violating anyone’s comfort zone?</em></p>
	<p class="quotation">—Rem Koolhaas, <em>TIME</em> , 2016</p>	

<p class= "articlewords">I cannot help but view these two paragraphs as a scathing, tongue-in-cheek critique of Ingels’ oversized ego. Likening him to a Silicon Valley thinker is remarkably appropriate. A lack of existential handwringing being one step closer to <em>we were so busy trying to see if we could, we failed to ask if should</em> and one step too far from meaningful reflection. Quite literally, he manages to have his quiche and eat it too. This, it appears, is at the crux of his identity as a designer. Koolhaas has managed a near perfect characterization; one that Ingels, himself, is likely very proud of. It follows, then, that in almost every respect, vapidity included, he is the perfect subject for <em>Abstract’s </em>interminable style. 
</p>

<p class= "articlewords">His episode opens with a scene from Christopher Nolan’s <em>Inception</em>. Buildings bend to Leonardo DiCaprio’s will, breaking the rules of convention and showcasing the infinite potential of the dream state while Ingels’ mentions something about architecture’s ability to realize pure fiction. Far from flashy, innocuous drivel, this moment represents Ingels’ particularly poisoned worldview—that of the <em>playful</em> starchitect.</p>

<p class= "articlewords">The biography continues, posing as the story of a misunderstood protagonist rising through the ranks of his field against all odds. Despite the skeptics, Bjarke has emerged as the designer for the modern age—and did I mention how young he is? His critics are presented either as internet trolls or paternalistic figures worried that he may be spread too thin or be working too hard. Where the former is immediately dismissed as unworthy of attention, the latter would be more convincing as a response to the prompt <em>name your biggest weakness</em> than as valid constructive criticism.  </p>
	
<p class= "articlewords">Currents of idealism run strongly through the episode. Ingles constantly constructs sentences with the words: “pragmatic utopia” or “you can do it all, you don’t have to choose”. Speaking about <em>CopenHill</em>, his highly popular ski-slope-on-a-powerplant, Ingels claims that the building’s chimney, “instead of a symbol of pollution, becomes a celebration.” A celebration because of his unrealized intention to transform its traditional plume into a cartoonish smoke ring, I guess.</p>
	
<p class= "articlewords">This notion of fun, or playfulness, is the primary distinction between Ingles architecture and the austere, modernist utopian visions of yore. Still, I have a hard time believing that his structures, often completely devoid of recognizable typology, traditional convention, and made primarily out of glass and steel, will age any more favorably than Le Corbusier’s Plan Voisin or Costa and Niemeyer’s Brasilia. Though, Ingels doesn’t seem to care. He believes that a city’s skyline should be made up of iconic silhouettes rather than contribute to a cohesive, vernacular urban fabric. Certainly, he is not alone in this regard. From Postmodernism to the current, hyper-individualistic style, the contemporary architectural establishment has been obsessed with buildings that make a statement; unfazed by their obvious lack of timelessness. </p>
	
<p class= "articlewords"> <em>Masterplanet</em>, his brand new technocratic plan to address climate change, flawlessly replicates the arrogant, playfully aloof ideology seething from his <em>Abstract</em> appearance. It touts an approach to sustainability that improves our standard of living <em>while</em> saving the planet. Though, it lacks localized subtlety and is bursting with egotism. Madeline Roache, who interviewed Ingels for <em>TIME</em>, rightly points out his colonialist mindset in drafting the plan. Of course, an international, unified strategy to combat global climate destabilization and its impending consequences is desperately needed. It’s just that Ingels shouldn’t be the one to draft it. Though, he plans to release a ten-part documentary series detailing the main points of his plan—which is fitting considering his biggest strength may be his hypnotically convincing way of presenting a proposal. He is seductive, a businessman through and through.</p>
	
<p class="articlewords"><em>Abstract’s</em> visuals, music, and editing choices expertly reflect the affable grandeur of Ingels’ utopian idealism and architecture’s remarkable ability to realize it. Revealingly, his adolescent dreams of environmentalism are a running theme throughout the episode. Though, in typical greenwashing fashion neither Ingles, nor the showrunners, care to discuss any concrete examples of his sustainable achievements. That is not to mention the glaring failure to acknowledge architecture’s remarkable impact on our environment, writ large. Like <em>Abstract </em>itself, Ingles has a knack for masking a complete lack of substance in an eye-catching façade. The episode concludes cyclically, where it began. Ingels presents an alarming dichotomy divorced from nuance and rooted in fiction: We can either use the immense power we possess over our environment to create a nightmare or to realize our dreams. <em>He</em> is in the dream business. </p>

<p class="quotationwords"><em>Consumerism is no longer about conformity; it is about difference. </p></em>
	
<p class="quotation">—Thomas Frank, Why Johnny Can’t Dissent, 1995</p>
	
<p class="articlewords">Individualism and expression, once considered rebellion from the stark obedience of puritanical suburbia, have long since become the hallmark buzzwords of consumerism; representative of a new brand of conformity. Silicon Valley, that perfect amalgamation of Stewart Brand’s cybernetic optimism and the leaching tendrils of big business, was literally born co-opting countercultural attitudes. Despite posing as champions of the hip and the revolutionary, nowhere could you find a more homogenous idolatry of the market, technology, and capital. </p>

<p class="articlewords">Netflix, performing an elegant balancing act between Silicon Valley and The Culture Trust, has managed to adopt the faux-countercultural attitudes of the former while building upon the consolidation and pacification of the ladder, all in the name of consumption. Not only was its business model <em>revolutionary</em>, it necessarily <em>liberated</em> its customers by providing an endlessly diverse buffet of choice, free of ads! Right?</p>

<p class="articlewords">And yet, <em>Abstract</em>, a show undoubtedly focused on self-expression, is little more than a cleverly devised advertisement for Corporate America; a 45-minute infomercial selling you beautiful cars, shoes, graphics, education, architecture, and applications where Chrysler, Nike, Pentagram, MIT, BIG, and Facebook are the real stars of the show. The designers represent the tangible and friendly face of these corporations, ultimately humanizing them. Their personal narrative and benevolence become misconstrued as that of the company they work for. Further, <em>Abstract</em> perpetuate’s Silicon Valley’s modus operandi by co-opting the creativity and influence of art and design while disguising the design establishment as countercultural celebrities. Though, a quick glance at the list of some of its stars—Gilles, Hatfield, Scher, Oxman, Ingels, and Spalter—reveals the truth. These people <em>are</em> the establishment and they are selling you an ideology, if not an outright product. Much like Ingles’ ideal skyline, they are hugely influential and icons in their respective fields, but they are not iconoclasts. Conformity, albeit through the fetishization of individualism, is endemic rather than anathema to the establishment. Still, the show is called abstract, presenting change-makers and visionaries who have transformed design forever. It seems much more plausible that these designers have, in fact, perpetuated the existing ideologies of design and capital; dressing them up in new clothes, or disguising them as an artificial ski slope, for example. </p>

<p class="articlewords"> <em>Abstract</em> does not showcase design for design’s sake, or art for art’s sake. Instead, in bad faith, it transforms these modes of expression—of individual self-expression—into an avenue for capital and a tool for indoctrination. In this regard, design, much like <em>Abstract</em> itself, is damningly related to consumer marketing. Unfortunately, while this characterization fails to capture the emotionally poignant aspects of expression, it speaks more truth than otherwise in the context of our commercialized society. </p>

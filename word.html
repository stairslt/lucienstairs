	<h1 class=headertext> On <em>Abstract</em> and the Trouble with Self-Expression</h1>
		<p class= "words"> I. The Culture Trust’s New Clothes</p>
<p class= "quotationwords"><em>Working and consuming from our houses, wired happily into what Harper’s magazine has called the electronic hive, we will each be corporate subjects—consumers and providers of “content”—as surely we were the hapless industrial proletarians of the last century.</em></p>
		<p class="quotation">—Thomas Frank, The New Gilded Age, 1995</p>

<p class= "articlewords">Looking back at Thomas Frank’s eerie predictions, I can’t help but feel that this bleak, uninviting future has been realized. With clarity, he observed the transformation of entertainment as such into the cultural capital of the Information Age. In the twenty-five years since, America’s Culture Trust has grown into a hulking and bloated beast. It ceaselessly churns out content: pacifying dissent, promoting consumption, and further consolidating power. Culture, it seems, remains a steadfast export of our crumbling empire. (Culture and the implements of war, of course.) Netflix, along with the other streaming giants, represents a change of face for the Culture Trust. The modus operandi remains, but the image has been refreshed.  </p>
<p class= "articlewords">  By the nature of its model, Netflix executives don’t have to care about watch time, per se. Rather, it is more important that they produce as much content as possible, with as much flavor and variety as is necessary to satisfy a binge-obsessed consumer base. Rather than focus on quality or longevity, they choose to throw exorbitant amounts of money at quantity. And still, despite altogether lackluster programming, I would be hard-pressed to overstate its hegemonic hold on the zeitgeist. In 2017, Netflix spent six billion dollars on streaming rights and original content. Among the lineup was the biographical docuseries:  <em>Abstract: The Art of Design.</em> </p>

<p class= "articlewords">From its opening moments, it is clear that <em>Abstract</em> is extremely cool. At least, it desperately wants you to think that it is. The titles are colorful and flash onto the screen in an intentionally creative manner. The typefaces are minimalist and sans-serif. The score is both momentously orchestral and excitingly electronic. In 2019, it was even nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design. Everything is refined and carefully designed. Admittedly, this is all to be expected for a show dedicated to documenting the titans of graphic design, architecture, typography, art, and everything in between. Nevertheless, it would be remiss of me to fail to mention this <em>cool</em> factor. </p>
	
<p class= "articlewords">With its shine and high production value, <em>Abstract</em> purposes to appeal to a broad audience. In accordance with most Netflix programming, it is accessible without being boring. That is, it is impossible to be bored because you are only ever a few moments away from a new and exciting animation or montage or, best of all, sequence of cinematic drone footage. Content be damned, this is the age of constant visual stimulation. More specifically and egregiously, however, <em>Abstract</em> feigns depth and intellect without offering more than an ounce of critical reflection. Naturally, the documentary medium is far from objective—every aspect of a production is necessarily instrumental in advocating for a specific ideology. For <em>Abstract</em>, that comes in the form of idolizing iconic designers in a realm ultimately devoid of context, consequence, and meaningful criticism. </p>
	
<p class= "articlewords">Yet, according to creator and executive producer Scott Dadich, <em>Abstract</em> ’s message centers on the claim that “we all design our own lives through the thousands of decisions we make each day, and every single choice we make matters.” And, sure, maybe you could successfully reason that this extremely one-dimensional philosophy is valid from a semantics standpoint, but you would be hard pressed to argue that it is marginally significant. I wonder, then, what exactly is the purpose of calling <em>everyone</em> a designer besides a hollow attempt at democratization? Ironically if this is the goal, it is immediately derailed by the particularly blatant lack of diversity in the show’s lineup of visionaries. Lest you forget, this is the Culture Trust we are dealing with, however innocuous it all may seem. </p>
	
<p class= "words"> II. Hail to the Pragmatic Utopia</p>
<p class= "articlewords"> Bjarke Ingels, architecture’s preeminent wunderkind, is playful, self-obsessed, and startlingly seductive.  In almost every respect, vapidity included, Ingels is the perfect subject for <em>Abstract</em> ’s style of biographical documentary. His episode, dare I say the climax of the first season, masterfully demonstrates the interminable hubris of both Ingels and <em>Abstract</em> ’s production team. </p>
	
<p class= "articlewords"> It opens with a scene from Christopher Nolan’s <em>Inception</em>. Buildings bend to Leonardo DiCaprio’s will, breaking the rules of convention and showcasing the infinite potential of the dream state. Ingels’ voice over mentions something about architecture’s ability to realize pure fiction. It may appear as if I am nitpicking, and that very well may be the case. Nonetheless, the principles lying beneath the surface of this moment act as an incredibly poignant harbinger of the poisoned rhetoric to come. </p>

<p class= "articlewords">The biography continues, playing out as the story of a misunderstood protagonist rising through the ranks against all odds. Despite the skeptics, Bjarke has emerged as <em>the</em> designer for the modern age. (And did I mention how young he is?) His critics are presented either as internet trolls or paternalistic figures worried that he may be spread too thin or working too hard. (Which would be more convincing as a response to the prompt: <em>name your biggest weakness</em> than as valid constructive criticism.)</p>

<p class= "articlewords">Currents of idealism run strongly through his portfolio. He constantly constructs sentences with words like “playfulness” and “pragmatic utopia” and “you can do it all, you don’t have to choose”. Speaking about the utopian possibilities of “Copenhill” (his highly popular ski slope on a power plant), Ingels claims that the building’s chimney, “instead of a symbol of pollution, becomes a celebration.” A celebration because it lets off its emissions in the form of a smoke ring, rather than the traditional, less beautiful cloud, I guess. Similarly, the episode alludes to Ingels’ early dreams of environmentalism without actually addressing the elephant that is architecture's massive impact on the planet. </p>

<p class= "articlewords">Undoubtedly, his ideas are more fun than the austere, modernist utopian visions of yore. Yet, I have a hard time believing that his structures, often completely devoid of recognizable typology, traditional convention, and made primarily out of glass and steel, will age any more favorably than Le Corbusier’s Plan Voisin or Costa and Niemeyer’s Brasilia. Though, Ingels doesn’t seem to care. He believes that a city’s skyline should be made up of iconic silhouettes rather than contribute to a cohesive urban fabric. Certainly, he is not alone here. From Postmodernism to the current, hyper-individualistic style, the contemporary architectural establishment has been obsessed with buildings that make a statement; unphased by their obvious lack of timelessness. </p>
	
<p class= "articlewords">In 2016, Ingels was named one of <em>TIME</em> magazine’s 100 most influential people. Rem Koolhaas, architecture’s iconic bad boy of the nineties and early aughts, wrote the tribute: </p>

<p class="quotationwords"><em>Contrary to many, maybe including himself, I do not consider Bjarke Ingels the reincarnation of this or that architect from the past. On the contrary, he is the embodiment of a fully-fledged new typology, which responds perfectly to the current zeitgeist. Bjarke is the first major architect who disconnected the profession completely from angst. He threw out the ballast and soared. With that, he is completely in tune with the thinkers of Silicon Valley, who want to make the world a better place without the existential hand-wringing that previous generations felt was crucial to earn utopianist credibility. </em></p>
<p class="quotationwords"><em>We are friends. Once, during lunchtime, I used his office to prepare a competition presentation. (We lost.) On the menu that day was quiche. Wow, I wondered, so you can do great architecture without violating anyone’s comfort zone?</em></p>
	<p class="quotation">—Rem Koolhaas, <em>TIME</em> , 2016</p>
<p class="articlewords">I cannot help but view these two paragraphs as a scathing, tongue-in-cheek critique of Ingels’ oversized ego. Likening him to a Silicon Valley thinker is remarkably appropriate. A lack of existential handwringing being one step closer to: <em>we were so busy trying to see if we could, we failed to ask if should</em>; and one step too far from meaningful reflection. Quite literally, he manages to have his quiche and eat it too. This, it seems, is at the crux of his identity as a designer. Koolhaas has managed a near perfect characterization; one that Ingels, himself, is likely very proud of. </p>
<p class="articlewords"><em>Abstract</em> fails to mention this accolade, but through everything else it doesn’t miss a step. Its visuals, music, and editing choices all contribute perfectly to Ingels’ rhetoric of utopian idealism and architecture’s remarkable ability to realize it. The episode concludes cyclically, where it began. Ingels presents an alarming dichotomy. We can either use the immense power we possess over our environment to create a nightmare or to realize our dreams. <em>He</em> is in the dream business.

<p class="articlewords">These days, he is dreaming bigger than ever. “Masterplanet,” his technocratic utopian plan to address climate change, furthers his brand of idealism. It touts an approach to sustainability that improves our standard of living while saving the planet. Though, it lacks localized nuance and is bursting with egotism. Madeline Roache, who interviewed Ingels for <em>TIME</em> ’s reporting on The Great Reset’s neoliberal plan for the future (sponsored by SOMPO Holdings, one of Japan’s largest insurance groups), rightly points out his arrogant, colonialist mindset in drafting the plan. Of course, an international, unified strategy to combat global climate destabilization and its impending consequences is desperately needed. It’s just that Ingels shouldn’t be the one to do it. Though, he plans to release a ten-part documentary series detailing the main points of his plan. Which is fitting considering his biggest strength may be his hypnotically convincing way of presenting a proposal. Like I said before, he is seductive—a businessman through and through. </p>
<p class= "words"> III. Capital and Conformity</p>
<p class="quotationwords"><em>Consumerism is no longer about conformity; it is about difference. 
 </p></em>
	<p class="quotation">—Thomas Frank, <em>Why Johnny Can’t Dissent</em>, 1995</p>
<p class="quotationwords"><em>Capitalism is about self-expression; art is about self-expression. Art is far from being a radical outside movement. It’s at the heart of the modern conformity.</p></em>
<p class="quotation">—Adam Curtis interviewed by Yancey Strickler, The Creative Independent, 2017</p>
<p class="articlewords">Where <em>The New Gilded Age</em> sees Frank grappling with the Culture Trust, <em>Why Johnny Can’t Dissent</em> is his take on the transformation of business as the adversary of counterculture to the purveyor and adopter of its ideals. Individualism and expression, once considered rebellion from the stark obedience of 1950’s suburbia, have become the hallmark buzzwords of consumerism; representative of a new brand of conformity. Amazon will happily sell you a myriad of graphic tees with “capitalist pig” plastered across the front in bold red letters, for example. We consume to stand out, and in doing so, blend in with the crowd. Business has adapted, while the counterculture has not. </p>

<p class="articlewords">Unsurprisingly, Netflix is a perfect amalgamation of the Culture Trust and the attitudes of Silicon Valley. Nowhere is the notion of conformity less prevalent than Big Tech. Famously, tech companies are champions of the hip, the revolutionary, and the cool. And yet, nowhere could you find a more homogenous idolatry of the market, technology, and capital. </p>

<p class="articlewords">Here, Adam Curtis’ assertion rings true. <em>Abstract</em> is undoubtedly about self-expression. Therefore, it is inherently tied to capital. More than just a mouthpiece for the design status quo, it is a cleverly devised advertisement for Corporate America; a 45-minute infomercial selling you beautiful cars, shoes, graphics, education, architecture, and apps where Chrysler, Nike, Pentagram, MIT, BIG, and Facebook are the real stars of the show. The designers represent the tangible and friendly face of these massive companies. For example, an interview with the parents of UI/UX designer Ian Spalter acts to humanize Instagram, and ultimately Facebook, by association. The designer’s personal narrative and benevolence is misconstrued as that of the company that they represent. </p>

<p class="articlewords"><em>Abstract</em> is playing a role, co-opting the creativity and influence of art and design while disguising the design establishment as countercultural icons. Though, a quick glance at the list of some of its stars—Gilles, Hatfield, Scher, Oxman, Ingels, and Spalter—reveals the truth. These people <em>are</em> the establishment and they are selling you an ideology, if not an outright product. They are hugely influential and icons in their respective fields, but they are not iconoclasts. Still, the show is called abstract, presenting these figureheads as “changemakers” and “visionaries” who have transformed design forever. It seems much more plausible that these designers have, in fact, perpetuated the existing ideologies of design and capitalism; dressing it up in new clothes, or disguising it as an artificial ski slope, for example. Perhaps, <em>Conformity: The Art of Design </em>would have made for a more apt title. </p>
